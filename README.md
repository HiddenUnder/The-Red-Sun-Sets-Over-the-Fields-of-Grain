# The Red Sun Sets Over the Fields of Grain
Life on the farm is not as simple as it once was...

You return home one day and are provoked into committing murder. Life appears to carry on as normal after the killing, but is everything truly all right? Can you forget your deep-seated guilt by planting crops and buying power-ups? Can you ignore the glaring reminders of your past?

This seemingly simple and fun iPhone game raises questions about complacency and mindlessness in smartphone video game culture. Rather than simply tap away and watch the gold coins increase, *The Red Sun Sets* pushes its users to carry the burden of the main character, establishing a strong link between the player and the character that the player controls.
