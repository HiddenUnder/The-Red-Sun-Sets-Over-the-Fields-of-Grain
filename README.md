# The Red Sun Sets Over the Fields of Grain
Life on the farm is not as simple as it once was...

You return home one day and are provoked into committing murder. Life appears to carry on as normal after the killing, but is everything truly all right? Can you forget your deep-seated guilt by planting crops and buying power-ups? Can you ignore the glaring reminders of your past?

This seemingly simple and fun iPhone game raises questions about complacency and mindlessness in smartphone video game culture. Rather than simply tap away and watch the gold coins increase, *The Red Sun Sets* pushes its users to carry the burden of the main character, establishing a strong link between the player and the character that the player controls.

## Playing / installing
Unfortunately, this app violates several of Apple's [app approval guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/), such as (and these are direct quotes):
* If your app is plain creepy, it may not be accepted
* If your App was cobbled together in a few days, it likely will not be accepted
* We will reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, "I'll know it when I see it". And we think that you will also know it when you cross it
* Apps portraying realistic images of people or animals being killed or maimed, shot, stabbed, tortured or injured will be rejected
* Apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected
* Apps that are primarily designed to upset or disgust users will be rejected

Thus, the app will never make it onto the app store in its current state.

If you wish to play the app, clone this repository, open it in Xcode, and run it on your iPhone (or in the emulator, although the experience is much better on iPhone).
